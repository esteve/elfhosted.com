## How to use Immich

!!! warning "Immich requires BYO storage"
    You'll need to attach your own cloud storage to your ElfHosted stack, to take advantage of Immich. An excellent choice for attaching cloud storage is a [Hetzner Storagebox][storagebox], which can optionally be encrypted.

### Attach storage

Ensure you have a suitable BYO storage mount attached (confirm the location is browsable in [FileBrowser][filebrowser]), you can use Rclone to set up a remote to point to your external storage.

### Configure 

Use ElfBot to configure Immich to point to your mounted storage location, by running something like:

```
elfbot env immich UPLOAD_LOCATION=/storage/rclone/YOUR_REMOTE
```
